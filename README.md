Functionality: I would give myself a 3 in functionality because I have the decrypting and encrypting done and working, as well as the command line interface working.

Object Oriented Programming: I would give myself a 4 in OOP because I decided to use a module. I can also explain why I chose to use a module as well as why I think it improved the organization of the project.

Ruby Conventions: I would give myself a 3 for this section of the rubric. I think a 3 is accurate because I have two methods that are 15 lines long and I am not using any mocks or stubs. Therefor I cant get a 4. I do have a couple hashes though and I think they all make logical sense.

Test Driven Development: I think I would get a 3 for TDD. I have tested every method, even all helper methods with all edge cases addressed. I also have 100% test coverage.

Version Control: For version control I would give myself a 4. I currently have 69 commits and those commits and pull requests contain related pieces of functionality.
